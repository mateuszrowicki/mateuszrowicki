Hello there!

I'm an aerospace engineer (25 yo), currently working on my own ADCS 😊  
I live in Warsaw, Poland.


If I had to tell only one thing about things I love, it would be that:  
I love cooking! (especially mediterranean cuisine) 🥰

P.S.
Listen to "Your song" by Elton John, for me, it's one of the most moving songs. 🥹
